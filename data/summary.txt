    "The meeting focused on designing a rate limiting service to protect backend systems from sudden surges in requests.",
    "Manish proposed placing the rate limiter in an API gateway or as a dedicated service, acting as a shield for the main application.",
    "A requirement was discussed to limit clients to 100 requests per minute.",
    "Manish recommended using the sliding window counter algorithm for implementing the rate limiter, comparing it with fixed and sliding window algorithms."

    "Manish Reddy": "Manish started by asking about the core goals for the rate limiting service. He suggested placing the rate limiter in an API gateway or a dedicated service to act as a shield and prevent resource exhaustion by heavy users. He then proposed using the sliding window counter algorithm for its implementation.",
    "Interviewer": "The Interviewer welcomed Manish and introduced the topic of designing a rate limiting service. They clarified that the primary goal is to protect backend services from sudden and potentially malicious surges in requests."
